# learn-vision

This is a repository for learning computer vision concepts and techniques. I created this repository to learn vision models that are popular in the field of computer vision such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion Models, and more to learn about their architectures, training methods, and applications in pytorch.

# Virtual Environment Setup:

My python version is `3.12` which I am using for this project.

```bash
python --version
```

To create a virtual environment for this project, use the following command:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

I am using `macOS`. Command to activate the virtual environment on macOS is:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Installation

To install the required dependencies, please run the following command:

```bash
pip install .
```
